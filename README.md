# KHABO

Welcome to KHABO, your personalized meal delivery service designed to simplify meal planning, cater to your dietary needs, and ensure convenience in your busy lifestyle. With KHABO, you can effortlessly plan your meals, customize packages, and enjoy delicious, nutritious food delivered right to your doorstep.

## Scenario:

Meet Hakkim, a bachelor who does not know how to cook nor does he want to bother. He does not want to hire someone to do so because he feels uncomfortable as he does not stay at home much and he has some health concerns and dietary constraints which he must maintain. He did not like ordering from Foodpanda everyday and wasting half his time just scrolling for the right meal. So he decided to go to ‘KHABO’ s website. After entering the homepage he was greeted with a few options.

After logging in, he was able to set either a weekly plan, a monthly plan or even a yearly plan. He could make his own packages from ‘KHABO’s selection of food to be delivered to his home, he could set a menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner separately. He could also select pre-made packages that follow various dietary methods or health concerns (Keto, low carb high protein, Diabetic, etc.). He could also customize those packages as well. If he wanted he could add his health information and using those ‘KHABO’ can  suggest the best package for him according to his required calories or health issues. ‘KHABO’ can maintain a calorie count according to the food he consumes.

He could set an auto payment method according to his plan and the amount of food he wants in his packages. Hakkim can cancel his plan anytime and modify his packages whenever he desires. He can set the delivery location to wherever he desires using google maps and before any delivery is on its way ‘KHABO’ is able to confirm his location if he desires to share his live location. Since Hakkim is not comfortable with that, he can also confirm manually through the website, he can schedule deliveries and cancel on the days he does not want food delivered.

To not waste food from ‘KHABO’, delivery is only made if Hakkim confirms. If Hakkim wants he can turn on the option to receive a call before any delivery is on its way.

Hakkim is really happy to have a service such as ‘KHABO’ because he does not have to worry about overspending, overeating or wasting food.
