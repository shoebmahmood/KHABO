# KHABO

Welcome to KHABO, your personalized meal delivery service designed to simplify meal planning, cater to your dietary needs, and ensure convenience in your busy lifestyle. With KHABO, you can effortlessly plan your meals, customize packages, and enjoy delicious, nutritious food delivered right to your doorstep.

## Scenario:

Meet Hakkim, a bachelor who does not know how to cook nor does he want to bother. He does not want to hire someone to do so because he feels uncomfortable as he does not stay at home much and he has some health concerns and dietary constraints which he must maintain. He did not like ordering from Foodpanda everyday and wasting half his time just scrolling for the right meal. So he decided to go to ‘KHABO’ s website. After entering the homepage he was greeted with a few options.

After logging in, he was able to set either a weekly plan, a monthly plan or even a yearly plan. He could make his own packages from ‘KHABO’s selection of food to be delivered to his home, he could set a menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner separately. He could also select pre-made packages that follow various dietary methods or health concerns (Keto, low carb high protein, Diabetic, etc.). He could also customize those packages as well. If he wanted he could add his health information and using those ‘KHABO’ can  suggest the best package for him according to his required calories or health issues. ‘KHABO’ can maintain a calorie count according to the food he consumes.

He could set an auto payment method according to his plan and the amount of food he wants in his packages. Hakkim can cancel his plan anytime and modify his packages whenever he desires. He can set the delivery location to wherever he desires using google maps and before any delivery is on its way ‘KHABO’ is able to confirm his location if he desires to share his live location. Since Hakkim is not comfortable with that, he can also confirm manually through the website, he can schedule deliveries and cancel on the days he does not want food delivered.

To not waste food from ‘KHABO’, delivery is only made if Hakkim confirms. If Hakkim wants he can turn on the option to receive a call before any delivery is on its way.

Hakkim is really happy to have a service such as ‘KHABO’ because he does not have to worry about overspending, overeating or wasting food.

## Specification:

- **Technology Stack:** MERN stack, OpenAI, Google Maps

## Feasibility Analysis

### Technical Feasibility:

The system requirements are technically feasible. Our chosen framework which is MERN Stack can easily support secure user authentication, profile management, meal planning, customization delivery management, and user interface/experience requirements. Integration with Google Maps for location services and encryption for data security are also well-established practices. We can also handle Subscriptions but for the payment method we can use a dummy system just to show that it is working for this project (Stripe can be implemented for this case). We can use Open AI to implement our chat bot without any issue.

### Operational Feasibility:

The system appears to be operationally feasible. It aligns with current trends in the food delivery industry, such as meal customization and health-conscious options. The system’s focus on user-friendly interfaces and clear instructions should facilitate user adoption.

### Economic Feasibility:

The system does seem economically feasible and costs would include development, maintenance, and operational costs (such as delivery and ingredient sourcing) but benefits would come from user subscriptions and potential partnerships with health and wellness entities.

### Schedule Feasibility:

Considering our Team of four, we can easily build this product but because of our inexperience with MERN stack it may require some time which is why we are trying to start as early as possible, so that we can keep up with the sprints and finish building our product before our deadline.
